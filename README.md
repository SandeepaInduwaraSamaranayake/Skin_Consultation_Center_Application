### Project Description

#### Console Menu Implementation

The following management actions can be perfomed using the console application,

1. Add a new doctor to the system - It is possible to add a new doctor, with all the relevant information.
2. Delete a doctor from the system - Selecting the medical licence number. Display a message with the information of the doctor that has been deleted and the total number of doctors in the centre
3. Print the list of the doctors in the consultation centre - For each doctor, print on the screen all the stored information. The list will be ordered alphabetically according to the doctor surname
4. Save in a file - All the information entered by the user so far. The next time the application starts it will be able to read back all the information saved in the file and continue to use the system

#### Graphical User Interface (GUI) Implementation

The following management actions can be perfomed using the Graphical User Interface,

1. The user can visualise the list of doctors with relative information. The user will be able to sort the list alphabetically.
2. The user can select a doctor and add a consultation with that specific doctor.
3. The user can check the availability of the doctor in specific date/time and can book a consultation for a patient if the doctor is available. If the doctor is not available automatically another doctor will be allocated, who is available in that specific date/time. The choice of the doctor has to be done randomly among all available doctors
4. Add patient information ( name, surname, date of birth, mobile number, id).
5. Enter and save the cost for the consultation. Each consultation is £25 per hour and the first consultation is £15 per hour.
6. Add some notes ( his could be textual information). This information will encrypted in order to preserver data privacy.
7. Once the consultation has been saved in the system, the user can select it and visualise all the stored information.
